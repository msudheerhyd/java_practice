0. MIND and only MIND is the center of everything. Everything you do, don't do that you regret is because of YOU not being able to control your mind. Such a state is called suffering. Close your eyes and sit for some time daily and one day you will be able to control your mind. Such a state is called Enlightenment."
																			-Buddha
